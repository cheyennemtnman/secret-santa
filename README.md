# secret-santa

Given a list of names and email addresses, this small Node.js module takes all of the hassle out of working out secret santa recipients. Simply run the module, and it'll email everyone in the list with their gift recipient.

The code makes sure you don't receive yourself as a recipient, and also ensures that no-one has more than one secret santa!

Ho, ho, ho...
